# AI-BASED-GENERATIVE-DESIGN-OF-HYDRO-POWER-PLANTS
An AI-driven approach to smart, sustainable hydropower engineering
📌 Overview
This project presents an end-to-end AI framework that automatically generates, optimizes, and evaluates hydropower plant designs.
Using data-driven modelling, generative design workflows, and predictive analytics, the system helps engineers create cost-efficient, energy-maximizing, and environmentally responsible hydro power layouts.
The system combines hydrology forecasting, topographical analysis, machine learning, CFD/FEA simulations, and computer vision for equipment monitoring.
🌱 Why This Project Matters
Current hydropower design is slow, manual, and iterative.
Environmental and geographical constraints require precise optimization.
Generative AI significantly reduces design time, improves energy yield, and lowers ecological impact.
Helps achieve SDG Goals 7, 9, and 13.
🚀 Key Features
1. Generative Design Engine
Automatically proposes multiple plant layout variations.
Considers constraints: terrain, cost, water flow, environmental limits.
2. AI-Powered Hydrology Forecasting
Predicts water inflow, rainfall patterns, reservoir fluctuations.
Utilizes ML regression, LSTM, and ensemble models.
3. Simulation + Optimization
Integrates with CFD/FEA tools (OpenFOAM/ANSYS).
Evaluates flow efficiency, turbine performance, and structural stresses.
4. Visual Fault Detection (CV)
YOLO/CNN-based corrosion detection for penstock, turbines, and metallic components.
Supports predictive maintenance.
5. Real-Time Monitoring Integration
Works with IoT sensors for continuous hydrological and equipment health data.
